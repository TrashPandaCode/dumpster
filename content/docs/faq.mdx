# FAQ

This section provides answers to frequently asked questions about the project. If you have a question that is not answered here, feel free to reach out to the community or check the project's documentation.

<Details summary="What is the main goal of this project?">
  The project aims to teach computer animation concepts through an interactive,
  gamified environment. Players learn by solving visual challenges using a
  node-based programming system.
</Details>

<Details summary="Who is this project designed for?">
  It's mainly targeted at students and anyone interested in the concepts of
  interactive systems. No prior programming experience is required.
</Details>

<Details summary="Do I need to know node based programming systems?">
  No, we try to slowly introduce you to the concepts of node based programming
  in the first few levels.
</Details>

<Details summary="Do I need to install anything to use it?">
  No installation is required — everything runs in the browser. Just open the
  site and start playing.
</Details>

<Details summary="Is this just for learning, or can I build real projects with it?">
  The main focus is on learning, and while the system is capable of prototyping
  real interactive behaviors, the current levels and nodes don't yet support
  fully custom solutions.
</Details>

<Details summary="How do levels progress in difficulty?">
  Each level builds on the last, introducing new concepts like loops, inverse
  kinematics, and abstraction gradually. This scaffolds learning without
  overwhelming the user.
</Details>

<Details summary="What if I get stuck on a level?">
  Hints are built into each level. For each level a level guide exists in the
  documentation. You can also revisit previous levels to reinforce earlier concepts.
</Details>

<Details summary="Can I share my solutions or learn from others?">
  No, the current platform doesn't yet include an option to share your solution.
  But solutions are saved so you can revisit them later. Tech savvy users could
  export and import solutions by modifying the local storage.
</Details>

<Details summary="Can nodes be copied between levels?">
  Yes, as long as you don't refresh the website (so no pressing
  <code>Ctrl+R, F5 or Ctrl+F5</code>).
</Details>

<Details summary="What is the meaning of the 3 small trashcans on the homepage?">
  The three small trashcans indicate level difficulty — from easiest (all
  trashcans are semi-transparent) to hardest (all trashcans are fully opaque).
</Details>

<Details summary="Can I reset my progress?">
  Yes, you can reset individual levels using the reset button in the level
  editor. Be careful though, as this will delete all your nodes for that level.
</Details>

<Details summary="I accidentally skipped the tutorial prompts.">
  You can restore all tutorial prompts and guidance messages previously skipped
  using the reset tutorial button in the help menu. The help menu can be
  accessed in each level using the button displaying a question mark.
</Details>

<Details summary="Help, the nodes don't work anymore.">
  If all things fail, you can try resetting the local storage. To clear the
  local storage for this webpage, right-click anywhere on the page, select
  "Inspect", go to the "Application" tab, and choose "Local Storage" from the
  sidebar — then right-click the entries and select "Clear". This{" "}
  <strong>must</strong> happen without any level loaded, so either from the
  homepage or docs pages.
