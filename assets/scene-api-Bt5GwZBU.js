## Scene API

We need some kind of Scene API that allows us to interact more easily with a low(er)-level API (like OpenGL). This includes, for example, creating objects (from meshes, etc.), lights, cameras, and similar components.

It makes sense to design the Scene API in an object-oriented manner.
