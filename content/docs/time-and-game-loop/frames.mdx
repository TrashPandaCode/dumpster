## Frames

* **Frame rate**: Indicates how many frames are displayed per second. Terms like *FPS*, *Hz*, and *frame rate* are used interchangeably.
* **Frame duration**: Also called *delta time* or *time delta*, it is the time interval between frames, usually in milliseconds. This is measured relative to real time.
* **Animation time**: The discretization by frames samples the animation. These sampling points are numbered and determine the animation time.

For example, playing a 24Hz film at double speed results in half the frame duration, but the animation time remains the same.
