## Composite Bézier Curves

Instead of one large Bézier curve with many control points, we can use **composite Bézier curves**:

* Each control point affects the entire Bézier curve—often undesirable.
* So we define a **piecewise Bézier curve**, composed of smaller Bézier segments.

Requirements for a **piecewise Bézier curve** $S$:

* $S$ must match each Bézier segment exactly.
* The last point of $B_i(t)$ must equal the first point of $B_{i+1}(t)$.
* The first point of $S$ equals the first of $B_0$, and similarly for the last point.

### Smoothness

To achieve **differentiability** or at least **$G^1$-continuity**, we need extra conditions on the control points:

* Using the tangent property, derivatives at the start and end of each segment can be used to align control points.
* For **$C^1$-continuity**, the derivatives at joint points must be exactly equal.
