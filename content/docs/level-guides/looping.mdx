# Level 10: Looping

## Objective

This level introduces the concept of **iteration using a for-loop** to control multiple gameobjects simultaneously. The player is presented with **five raccoons**, each standing in front of a **tower of wooden crates**. The task is to place each raccoon on top of their respective crate stack.

The solution can be achieved manually with five `Export` nodes, but the intended method is to **use a `for-loop` node** to process all raccoons in a single operation.

## Concepts to Learn

This level introduces **data-driven repetition** and **batch processing** in animation authoring. Players learn how to express scalable behaviors over collections of objects using **loop constructs**, **shared export interfaces**, and **index-driven logic**.

## Key Principles Introduced

- Use of **for-loops** in node-based systems
- **Indexing and data flow control**
- **Selection of multiple game objects** in export nodes
- **Shared attribute access** for heterogeneous sets
- **Data reuse through parametrization**

## Node Structure Example

In the export node, the user selects all five raccoons simultaneously. When multiple game objects are selected, the editor presents:

- An **intersection of common attributes**
- A **reorderable list** of selected objects

Proper ordering of raccoons is essential so that index `i` in the loop aligns with raccoon `i` in the export node's list.

## Relevant Documentation

- [For Loop Node](/docs/nodes/forloop)
- [Export Node](/docs/nodes/export)

## Educational Notes

This level emphasizes **abstraction and scalability** in animation logic. While earlier levels taught single-object control, this challenge requires the player to recognize:

- **Structural repetition** in spatial patterns
- The power of **parametric control** using loop indices
- The flexibility of **batch export operations**

Iterating over gameobjects is just one use case of for loops, as they can be used in many other iterative algorithms (e.g. the CCD algorithm).
