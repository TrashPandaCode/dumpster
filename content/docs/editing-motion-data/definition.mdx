# Editing Motion Data

The state of a skeleton is referred to as a **pose**. This state vector includes the translation and rotation of the root joint and the rotations of all other joints.

The set of all poses $\mathcal{X}$ is also called the **state space**:

$$
\mathcal{X} = \underbrace{\mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3}_{\text{Joint 1}} \times \mathbb{R}^3 \times \dots \times \underbrace{\mathbb{R}^3}_{\text{Joint n}} = \mathbb{R}^{3(n+1)}
$$

The rotations can also be represented using **quaternions**, using $S^3$ instead of $\mathbb{R}^3$.

The **motion function** (or simply: motion) maps time to a state in $\mathcal{X}$.

Motion data is linearly interpolated (using **slerp** for quaternions).
