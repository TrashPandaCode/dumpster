# Contributing Guidelines

## Branching Strategy

- **Don’t push breaking changes directly to `main`**
  If your changes are not stable or may break existing functionality, please **create a new branch**.

- **Push incomplete features to separate branches**
  Features that are still in development should be committed to their own feature branches.

- **Minor fixes and self-contained features can go to `main`**
  If your change is small, stable, and self-contained (e.g., minor bug fixes or trivial features), it’s okay to push directly to `main`.

## Pull Requests

- **All pull requests must be reviewed**
  Every pull request must be reviewed by **at least one other contributor** before merging.

- **Use draft pull requests for WIP**
  If your pull request is **not ready for review or merge**, open it as a **draft**. This helps others know it’s still in progress.

- **Review every push**
  Before merging any pull request, carefully **review all file changes**. Don’t merge without inspecting the diffs.
