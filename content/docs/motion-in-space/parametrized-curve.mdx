## Parametrized Curves

A *parametrized curve* is a mapping:

$$
f: I \to \mathbb{R}^d, \quad t \mapsto \vec{f}(t)
$$

Here, $t$ is called the parameter of the curve. Often, we simply refer to these as *curves*.

A curve can be expressed as:

$$
f(t) = \vec{f}_1(t), \dots, f_d(t)
$$

with *component functions*:

$$
f_i: I \to \mathbb{R}, \quad t \mapsto f_i(t)
$$
