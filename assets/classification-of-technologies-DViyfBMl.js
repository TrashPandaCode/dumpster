## Classification of Technologies

**Optical systems are the most widely used today.**

* **Outside-In System**: Sensors are placed in the environment, while markers (measuring objects) are on the body.
  *Example*: Optical systems with cameras and reflective markers on the actor.

* **Inside-Out System**: Sensors are on the body, while the data source is in the environment.
  *Example*: Electromagnetic systems that measure radiation from external sources.

* **Inside-In System**: Both sensors and data sources are on the body.
  *Example*: Electromechanical systems that use acceleration and gyroscope sensors to measure motion.
