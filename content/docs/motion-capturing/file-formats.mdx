## File Formats

Common formats include **C3D, ASF/ACM, and BVA**.
The most widely used format is **BVH** (BioVision Hierarchical file format), which stores data in ASCII format.

Keywords in a BVH file include:

* `HIERARCHY`
* `ROOT`
* `OFFSET`
* `CHANNELS`
* `JOINT`

These are used to represent the skeleton's topology hierarchically.

The second part of the file (`MOTION`) stores the animation data, which are linked to joints via the `CHANNELS` keyword.

A common challenge in BVH is the **order of rotation multiplications** (extrinsic vs. intrinsic).

### Advantages of BVH:

* Easy to read and edit due to plain text format

### Disadvantages:

* Skeletal geometry only defines relative joint positions
* No default pose with parallel joints
* No formal standardization
