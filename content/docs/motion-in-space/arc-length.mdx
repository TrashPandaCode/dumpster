## Arc Length

To measure the length of a curve, we are interested in the length of the *trace*, not the graph.

We approximate the curve using a **polygonal chain** over a **grid**. Summing the distances between grid points gives an approximation of the arc length.

* **Grid**: An ordered set over an interval.

  * *Dot-free*: all entries distinct.
  * *Equidistant*: all intervals are equal.

The finer the grid, the longer the estimated arc length. The *supremum* of all possible polygonal lengths gives the actual arc length.

If the length $L_f < \infty$, the curve is called **rectifiable**.

## Arc Length Function

For a rectifiable curve $f: [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^d$, the arc length function is:

$$
l_f: [a, b] \to [0, L_f], \quad l_f(t) = L_{f|_{[a, t]}}
$$

This describes the length of the curve up to time $t$.


## Numerical Approximation of Arc Length

Usually, arc length and its function can't be determined analytically — so we approximate them.

By definition, for a polygonal approximation $\mathcal{G}$:

$$
L(\mathcal{G}) \leq L
$$

For algorithm details, see the formula collection.

If the approximation $\tilde{l}: [a, b] \to [0, \tilde{L}]$ is strictly increasing:

$$
\tilde{l}_{i-1} < \tilde{l}_i \quad \forall i = 1, \dots, n
$$

then $\tilde{l}$ is invertible — always the case in practice.
