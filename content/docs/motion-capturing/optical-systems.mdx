## Optical Systems

* **Capture Volume**: The area within which the actor can move and motion can be recorded.

Optical systems are divided into two main types. All systems perform calculations at a fixed frame rate (typically 60â€“250 fps) to create the impression of smooth motion.

### Marker-Based Methods

The actor is fitted with reflective markers that reflect infrared light. The cameras are equipped with infrared light sources. Basic image processing isolates the markers in the images. If a marker appears in more than one camera, its 3D coordinates can be triangulated.

Since marker positions are predefined, a skeletal model can be derived.

### Markerless Methods

Markerless systems calculate the **visual hull** of the actor from camera footage. This hull can then be translated into a skeleton. Some systems (e.g., Kinect) also include depth data.
