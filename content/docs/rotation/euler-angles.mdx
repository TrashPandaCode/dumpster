## Euler Angles (Three Rotation Matrices)

Any rotation matrix in $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ can be expressed as a sequence of **three basic rotations**. So only **three parameters** ($\alpha, \beta, \gamma$) — the **Euler angles** — are needed.

* $X(\alpha) = R_{e_1}(\alpha)$
* $Y(\beta) = R_{e_2}(\beta)$
* $Z(\gamma) = R_{e_3}(\gamma)$

### Extrinsic Rotation:

*Rotation around the axes of the **reference coordinate system***

$$
R = Z(\gamma) Y(\beta) X(\alpha)
$$

This rotates the vector $v$ about the X, Y, and Z axes of the reference system in that order: $v' = Rv$

### Intrinsic Rotation:

*Rotation around the axes of the **object’s local coordinate system***

$$
R = X(\alpha) Y(\beta) Z(\gamma)
$$

Note: the local axes change after each rotation.

> When speaking of rotation in “X-Y-Z order,” this refers to the **order of rotations**, not the **order of matrix multiplications**.

### Gimbal Lock Problem

In this condition, **two rotation axes align**, reducing the system’s degrees of freedom. There are infinitely many sets of Euler angles that produce the same rotation matrix. This causes problems in animation.

### Interpolation

To interpolate between Euler angles for desired rotations, simply interpolate each of the three angles independently. Bézier curves can be used here, though the results may sometimes be unintuitive.
