# Particle Systems

Particle systems are useful for animating special systems of mass points. These usually have no sharp contours and appear "fuzzy," like smoke, stars, or rain.

All these phenomena are difficult to represent using polygon meshes because they:
- consist of many individual meshes,
- each change their trajectory,
- can change their shape,
- can disappear.

The characteristics of a particle system are:
- Consists of a collection of particles (mass points).
- The elements of the system are not static and can change their state. Particles can also be removed or added.
- The "shape" of the system is not fixed and can be influenced by randomness. They are _non-deterministic_.
