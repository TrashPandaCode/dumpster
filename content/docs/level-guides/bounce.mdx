# Level 3: Bounce

## Objective

In this introductory level, the player must set the **x** and **y** position of the raccoon character so that it aligns with the position of a **filled trashcan**. Each trashcan provides a `filled` output — a boolean indicating whether it contains trash. The `filled` state of the trashcans change over time.

The player is tasked with selecting the correct trashcan coordinates based on this condition, using **switch** nodes to route positional data conditionally.

## Concepts to Learn

This level introduces the fundamental idea of **conditional logic** in a node-based system, which corresponds to `if` statements in traditional programming. In node-based systems, conditional execution is **decomposed** into:

1. **Evaluation of a boolean condition** (e.g., using comparators like `==`, `>`, `<`)
   - Evaluating the `filled` state is not needed as it is already provided as a truth value
2. **Selection logic** (e.g., using a switch node to choose between values based on the condition)

## Key Principles Introduced

- Boolean values and conditional logic
- Separation of **evaluation** and **control**
- Use of **switch nodes** to branch behavior based on truth values

## Suggested Node Pattern

The user might, for example, connect each trashcan's `filled` output to a switch node that selects the associated x/y coordinates.

## Relevant Documentation

While this level is mainly logical in nature, it lays groundwork for spatial reasoning. The following topics will be relevant later:

- [Coordinate Systems](/docs/hierarchies/coordinate-systems)
- [Scene API](/docs/hierarchies/scene-api)

## Educational Notes

In traditional code, you might write:

```plaintext
IF trashcan1 is filled THEN
    raccoon's x-position <- trashcan1's x-position
ELSE
    raccoon's x-position <- trashcan2's x-position
END IF
```

In a node-based system, this becomes a **value-based graph**:

- One node evaluates `trashcan1.filled`
- A switch node uses this boolean to select between `trashcan1.x` and `trashcan2.x`

This architecture highlights a **dataflow model** of computation — the foundation of many animation and visual scripting environments.
