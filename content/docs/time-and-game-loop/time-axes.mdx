## Time Axes

In animation systems, we work with two different time axes that can run independently:

* **Physical/real-world time** is the time as we perceive it, measured as *real-time* by computer hardware. It cannot be paused or accelerated.
* **Game time** exists only within the animation system. It can be paused, reset, or sped up.

Both can be represented as real numbers $t \in \mathbb{R}$.

We can convert real-time into **animation time (local time)** using functions known as *animation clocks* or *global clocks*.
