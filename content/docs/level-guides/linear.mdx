# Level 5: Linear

## Objective

This level introduces the concept of **linear time transformation**, a foundational mechanism in animation systems where one time domain is mapped into another. The player must manipulate time values to control a **pocket watch** animation so that it corresponds to the behavior of a **clock tower**, with an applied time **scaling** and **offset**.

## Scenario

A non-functional watch awaits a time input. The player must construct a time signal that behaves differently from the reference clock tower's timeline. Through the in-game dialogue, it becomes evident that the pocket watch should run significantly faster and with a starting offset:

- A time offset of **50 seconds**
- A time scaling factor of **100**

These adjustments allow the player to create a new timeline that modifies the speed and phase of the animation independently of the base time axis.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand the principle of linear time transformation in animation.
- Learn to construct time-based expressions via node graphs.
- Develop intuition for how **offset** and **scaling** affect temporal behavior in animations.
- Apply mathematical thinking to dynamic system design.

## Key Concepts

### Time Axes

A **time axis** represents a mapping from real-world (or simulation) time to a local time domain used for evaluation. This abstraction allows decoupling different objects or animations from a global timeline, enabling fine-grained control of pacing and synchronization.

- [Global and Local Time Axes](/docs/time-and-game-loop/global-and-local-time-axes)

### Linear Time Transformation

A linear time transformation maps time `t` from one domain to another using the affine function:

$$
t' = a \cdot (t + b)
$$

Where:

- `a` is the **scaling factor** (controls speed)
- `b` is the **offset** (controls phase shift)

In animation, such transformations allow for:

- Fast-forwarding or slowing down animations
- Delaying or advancing their onset
- Creating desynchronized or nested animation loops

This level emphasizes the **mathematical simplicity** and **expressive power** of such mappings, which form the basis of more complex animation behaviors such as non-linear timing and procedural animation control.

## Interaction Goals

- Introduce a **Time Node** that provides a raw time signal.
- Use **arithmetic nodes** to apply a linear transformation to this signal.
- Connect the transformed time to the appropriate output or object input.
- Observe how visual elements respond in real-time to changes in the time signal.
