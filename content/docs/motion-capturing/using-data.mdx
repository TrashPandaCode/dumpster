title: Using Motion Capture Data

Purpose: Documentation for using motion capture data, including retargeting, foot sliding, and penetration issues.

## Using the Data

* **Retargeting**: Transferring animation data to a different skeleton.
* **Foot Sliding**: If skeletons have different proportions, the feet might not move in sync with the body, causing "skating" effects.
* **Penetration**: Skeleton mismatches can also lead to mesh self-intersections.
