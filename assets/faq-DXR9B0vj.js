gamified environment. Players learn by solving visual challenges using a
node-based programming system.`})}),`
`,e.jsx(t,{summary:"Who is this project designed for?",children:e.jsx(n.p,{children:`It's mainly targeted at students and anyone interested in the concepts of
interactive systems. No prior programming experience is required.`})}),`
`,e.jsx(t,{summary:"Do I need to know node based programming systems?",children:e.jsx(n.p,{children:`No, we try to slowly introduce you to the concepts of node based programming
in the first few levels.`})}),`

site and start playing.`})}),`
`,e.jsx(t,{summary:"Is this just for learning, or can I build real projects with it?",children:e.jsx(n.p,{children:`The main focus is on learning, and while the system is capable of prototyping
real interactive behaviors, the current levels and nodes don't yet support
fully custom solutions.`})}),`
`,e.jsx(t,{summary:"How do levels progress in difficulty?",children:e.jsx(n.p,{children:`Each level builds on the last, introducing new concepts like loops, inverse
kinematics, and abstraction gradually. This scaffolds learning without
overwhelming the user.`})}),`
`,e.jsx(t,{summary:"What if I get stuck on a level?",children:e.jsx(n.p,{children:`Hints are built into each level. For each level a level guide exists in the
documentation. You can also revisit previous levels to reinforce earlier
concepts.`})}),`
`,e.jsx(t,{summary:"Can I share my solutions or learn from others?",children:e.jsx(n.p,{children:`No, the current platform doesn't yet include an option to share your solution.
But solutions are saved so you can revisit them later. Tech savvy users could
export and import solutions by modifying the local storage.`})}),`
`,e.jsx(t,{summary:"Can nodes be copied between levels?",children:e.jsxs(n.p,{children:[`Yes, as long as you don't refresh the website (so no pressing

`,e.jsx(t,{summary:"What is the meaning of the 3 small trashcans on the homepage?",children:e.jsx(n.p,{children:`The three small trashcans indicate level difficulty — from easiest (all
trashcans are semi-transparent) to hardest (all trashcans are fully opaque).`})}),`
`,e.jsx(t,{summary:"Can I reset my progress?",children:e.jsx(n.p,{children:`Yes, you can reset individual levels using the reset button in the level
editor. Be careful though, as this will delete all your nodes for that level.`})}),`

using the reset tutorial button in the help menu. The help menu can be
accessed in each level using the `,e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"?"})," button."]})}),`

graphics and animations more efficiently. If it's turned off, you may notice
`,e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"significantly slower performance"}),". ",e.jsx("br",{}),` In most browsers, go to Settings
→ System → and make sure "Use hardware acceleration when available" is turned
on.`]})}),`
