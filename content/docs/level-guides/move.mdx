# Level 7: Move

## Objective

Implement a basic left/right movement controller for the raccoon character using keyboard input. The goal is to move the raccoon to the left and reach the flag.

## Scenario

The raccoon needs to move across the scene to reach a flag. You'll enable movement by connecting keyboard inputs to the raccoon's position. The character should move left when e.g. the **A** key is held and right when the **D** key is held.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this level, learners will:

- Understand how to build a simple input-driven movement controller.
- Learn how to make movement frame rate independent using **delta time**.
- Explore different approaches to movement and why direct position control is sometimes the best choice.
- Gain experience connecting multiple node types in a meaningful system.

## Key Concepts

### Movement Techniques

There are several common techniques for character movement in games:

- **Position-based movement**
  The character's position is updated directly each frame. This is the most straightforward method.

- **Velocity-based movement**
  Input changes a velocity value that is added to the position every frame. More flexible, but requires tracking velocity separately.

- **Physics-based movement**
  Forces are applied to a rigid body, allowing natural responses like friction and bouncing, but adds significant complexity.

- **Animation-driven movement**
  The character's motion is controlled through animation playback rather than direct position manipulation.

For this level, we use **position-based movement**, which is the simplest and most appropriate for beginner logic and deterministic control.

### Why Multiply by Delta Time?

Games typically run in a loop that updates many times per second — but the exact number of updates per second can vary depending on the computer’s performance, background processes, or the complexity of the scene.

If we just added a fixed amount to the raccoon's x-position each frame, the speed would vary depending on how fast the game is running.

To make movement frame rate independent, we multiply the movement amount by delta time — the time since the last frame. This ensures the raccoon moves the same distance per second, regardless of how many frames the game is running at.

Example:

- Without delta time: 10 pixels per frame → faster on high frame rates, slower on low ones.
- With delta time: 100 pixels per second → consistent speed on all machines.

## Strategic Goals

- The current x-position is imported from the raccoon using an ImportFromGameObject node.
- A KeyPress node outputs 1 when the A or D key is pressed.
- The key press value is multiplied by a speed constant and by delta time (from the Time node).
- The result is subtracted from or added to the raccoon's current x-position.
- The new position is sent back to the raccoon via an ExportToGameObject node.
