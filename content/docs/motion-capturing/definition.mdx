# Motion Capturing

Since keyframe animation heavily depends on the artist's skill and becomes very time-consuming for complex or human-like movements, we can instead record movements of real objects and transfer them to virtual characters.

Motion capturing is also referred to as *performance animation* or *performance capturing* (including face and prop tracking).
