## Animation and User Interface

The **weight vector** can be animated over time using curves. In practice, **sliders** are used in user interfaces to control the weightsâ€”particularly for facial expressions, where many targets may be used.

This allows for **semantic parameterization**, where certain weights have specific, meaningful interpretations (e.g., "smile", "frown", "eyebrow raise").
