## Distance Control

Often, we don't want to control speed directly, but instead specify fixed time points at which a certain distance along the curve (e.g., keyframes) should be reached.

We specify a new arc length function:

$$
l_{\text{new}} : [c, d] \rightarrow [0, L]
$$

To reparameterize $f : [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$, we then use:

$$
\varphi: [c, d] \rightarrow [a, b],\quad \varphi(t) = l_f^{-1}(l_{\text{new}}(t))
$$
