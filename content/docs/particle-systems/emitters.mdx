## Emitters

Emitters create and initialize new particles.

### Emission Rate

- **Continuous Emission**: We specify an emission rate $E \in \mathbb{R}^+$ independent of frame duration, representing particles per second. If $E$ is not a multiple of the frame rate, rounding errors may cause too many or too few particles per frame. This is solved with an accumulator counting in floating-point. When it exceeds a whole number, that number of particles is emitted and the remainder retained.

- **Emission over a Time Interval**: A time interval can either have a specified emission rate or a fixed number of particles to emit.

- **Other Methods**: $E$ can be changed dynamically, periodically, or randomly.

### Lifetime Initialization

Lifetimes are usually initialized using one of two random distributions, as systems with identical lifetimes for all particles are boring.

- **Uniform Distribution**: If a `unif()` method for the interval $[0,1]$ exists, a uniform distribution over any interval $[d_1, d_2]$ can be achieved with $(d_2 - d_1) \cdot \text{unif}() + d_1$.
- **Normal Distribution**: Sometimes `gauss()` methods are available for normal distributions.

### Position Initialization

- **Point Source**: All particles share the same starting position.

- **Curve**: Random position on a curve $f: [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}^3$ with uniform distribution over $[a,b]$. The particle density depends on the curve's speed: slower sections → more particles.

- **Surface**: If the object is a polygon mesh, each vertex can serve as a point source. This leads to a distribution dependent on vertex density. If the object has a parametric representation, a similar method can be used.

- **Volume**: Generate random points → if inside object → generate particle.

### Velocity Initialization

To initialize velocity, a direction vector of length $||r|| = 1$ and a speed $s$ are needed. Multiply the two:

$$
v = s \cdot r
$$

The direction can be random (e.g., on the unit sphere) or cone-shaped.
