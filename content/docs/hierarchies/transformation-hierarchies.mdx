## Transformation Hierarchies

For modeling and animation purposes, objects are often divided into multiple sub-objects. To avoid having to move each element individually during translation, the sub-objects are positioned **relative to each other**.

### Coordinate Transformation

The objects in a transformation hierarchy are connected via the coordinate transformation matrices mentioned in [Coordinate Systems](/docs/hierarchies/coordinate-systems).

When rendering, all transformation matrices must be traversed for each object to determine its world coordinates.

> **Transformation hierarchy tree:** A labeled tree graph. Each edge represents the coordinate transformation matrix from child to parent node. The arrows of the edges always point *upward*.
