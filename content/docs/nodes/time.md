# Time

The Time node displays and provides the current game time as well as the Delta time. It can be used to trigger events based on the time of day or to perform actions at regular intervals. It can also be used to measure the time taken for certain actions or events in the game. The Time node is useful for creating time-based events, such as day/night cycles, timed challenges, or cooldowns for abilities.

## Properties

- **Time**: The current game time in seconds. This value is updated every frame and can be used to trigger events based on the time from the start of a level or to perform further calculations.
- **Delta Time**: The time in seconds since the last frame. This value is updated every frame and is useful for creating smooth animations or movements that are frame-rate independent.
