## Velocity and Acceleration

* **Instantaneous velocity** is the rate of change of position at time $t$. It's defined as the derivative of the curve:

Let $f: I \to \mathbb{R}^d$ be a differentiable curve. Then

$$
v(t) = f'(t)
$$

is called the **velocity vector**, and its norm $\|v(t)\|$ is the **speed** at time $t$.

* **Acceleration** is the rate of change of velocity:

$$
a(t) = v'(t) = f''(t)
$$

A curve is differentiable if all component functions $f_i$ are differentiable:

$$
f'(t) = \left(f_1'(t), \dots, f_d'(t)\right), \quad f''(t) = \left(f_1''(t), \dots, f_d''(t)\right)
$$


## Tangent Vectors

To visualize **tangent vectors**, we can draw velocity vectors along the trace. The direction shows the increasing parameter $t$, and the length corresponds to the speed.
