# Key Press

The _Key Press_ node outputs a boolean value (1 for true, 0 for false) based on the state of a selected key â€” whether it is currently held down, just pressed, or just released.

You can choose both the key and the key event type (Down, Press, or Release).

## Properties

- **Value**: The output boolean indicating whether the selected key matches the chosen key event type.
