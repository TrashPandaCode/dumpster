## Coordinate Systems

Every object (including cameras and lights) has a **local object coordinate system**, whose origin is usually at the center of the object.

Various transformations (rotation, scaling, translation) convert this local coordinate system into a **common world coordinate system**. It is also possible to first transform from one object coordinate system to another (for _parenting_).

Such a **coordinate transformation matrix** converts coordinates from one coordinate system to another and represents a linear combination.

$$
W^{\text{world} \leftarrow \text{obj}} = T \cdot R \cdot S
$$

$$
W^{\text{obj} \leftarrow \text{world}} = \left(W^{\text{world} \leftarrow \text{obj}}\right)^{-1}
$$

The vector $p$ is transformed from object to world coordinates like this:

$$
p^{\text{world}} = W^{\text{world} \leftarrow \text{obj}} \cdot p^{\text{obj}}
$$
