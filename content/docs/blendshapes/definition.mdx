# Blendshapes

**Blendshapes** allow a base mesh to be morphed or interpolated into a deformed mesh (*blendshape target*). They are often used for complex animations—such as facial expressions—that would be too labor-intensive to animate using keyframes alone.

* **Blendshape Target**: A set of vertices, typically representing a polygon mesh. The vertex count between the base mesh and each blendshape target must be the same.
* **Blendshape Model**: A set of blendshape targets.

Blendshape models linearly interpolate between different blendshape targets.

To do this, we construct a **blendshape matrix** $B$, where each column contains all vertex positions of a target. A column is referred to as a **blendshape vector** $b_j$.

$$
B = 
\begin{pmatrix}
x_{1, 0} & \cdots & x_{1, n} \\
y_{1, 0} & \cdots & y_{1, n} \\
z_{1, 0} & \cdots & z_{1, n} \\
\vdots & & \vdots \\
x_{m, 0} & \cdots & x_{m, n} \\
y_{m, 0} & \cdots & y_{m, n} \\
z_{m, 0} & \cdots & z_{m, n}
\end{pmatrix}
\quad
\begin{aligned}
&\text{where } m = \text{number of vertices in the mesh} \\
&\text{and } n = \text{number of blendshape targets}
\end{aligned}
$$

We can now compute a **new mesh** using a weighted sum over the blendshape vectors:

$$
f = \sum_{k=0}^{n} w_k b_k \in \mathbb{R}^{3m}
$$

Here, $w = (w_0, \dots, w_n)^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is the **weight vector**.
This can also be written as a matrix operation:

$$
f = B w
$$
