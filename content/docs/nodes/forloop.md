# For Loop

The _For Loop_ consists of two connected nodes — _For Start_ and _For End_ — which together define a custom loop structure within the graph.

**Note**: All loop iterations are computed every frame. This means the entire loop is evaluated in full during each frame update, rather than being spread out over time.

## Overview

- **For Start**: Defines the loop inputs, number of iterations, and initial values.
- **For End**: Handles value updates at the end of each iteration and allows the loop to exit early via a break input.

The loop maintains a state between iterations, passing values from the _For End_ back to the _For Start_ node. On the final iteration, the final values from the _For End_ node are made available for use outside the loop.

Loops are color-coded with a dedicated edge style for easy visual identification.

## How It Works

1. Initial Setup:
   - In the _For Start_ node, use the input field to define loop variables (handles).
   - Each handle becomes an input and output on both the _For Start_ and _For End_ nodes.
2. First Iteration:
   - The values connected to the inputs of _For Start_ node are forwarded to its outputs and can be used within the loop body.
3. Subsequent Iterations:
   - At the end of each iteration, the _For End_ node inputs are passed back to the _For Start_ node outputs for the next iteration.
4. Final Output:
   - On the last iteration, the _For End_ node passes its input values to its outputs, making them available outside the loop.

## Properties

### For Start

- **Iterations**: Defines how many times the loop will run.
- **Handles**: Add input/output variables shared across loop iterations.

### For End

- **Break**: A boolean input. When true, the loop exits early.
- **Handles**: Inputs and outputs for each defined handle, used to update values between iterations and expose final results.

## Using nodes in loops

To add nodes inside the loop body right-click on either the _For Start_ or _For End_ node and use the context menu to insert new nodes. These will be included in the loop’s execution. This will not work in the example below.
