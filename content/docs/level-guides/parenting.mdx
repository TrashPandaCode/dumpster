# Level 4: Parenting

## Objective

In this level, the player must **parent a trashcan to the raccoon** so that the trashcan moves together with the raccoon as it runs back and forth. For this the node graph exposes:

- **Import nodes**: provide the current `x` and `y` position of the raccoon
- **Export nodes**: allow writing to the `x` and `y` position of the trashcan

By wiring the raccoon's positions directly into the trashcan's inputs, the user effectively **binds** the trashcan's transformation to the raccoon — a form of functional parenting.

The raccoon will then carry the trashcan toward a goal flag.

## Concepts to Learn

This level introduces the core principles of **transformation hierarchies** and **parenting** in animation systems.

## Key Principles Introduced

- **Parent-child relationships** between scene objects
- **Local vs. global coordinate systems**
- Reusing transformation data via **node-based bindings**
- Introduction to inheritance of position

## Node Structure Example

```plaintext
[Import: Raccoon x] ──▶ [Export: Trashcan x]
[Import: Raccoon y] ──▶ [Export: Trashcan y]
```

This simple binding reproduces the effect of parenting: the trashcan now **inherits** the transformation of the raccoon, remaining at a constant offset (zero, in this case).

The trashcan's position is now $$(0, 0)$$ in the raccoon's local coordinate system.

## Educational Notes

In many animation systems, parenting implies that a child object's **local transformation** is applied **relative to the parent's global transformation**. This level simulates this idea explicitly: the user must wire one object's transformation into another, creating a dependency in the node graph.

The same concept may allow offsets or rotations — but here, the goal is to understand **the fundamental mechanics** of transformation composition through node bindings.

This level also foreshadows advanced systems like:

- **Forward kinematics**, where transformations propagate down a hierarchy
- **Scene graph traversal**, where updates follow parent-child chains
