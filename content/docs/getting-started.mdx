# Getting Started

Welcome to the learning platform for computer animation and visual programming. Whether you're completely new or just need a refresher, this guide will walk you through the first steps.

## What is This?

This project is an interactive learning environment for computer animation concepts. It features:

- **Levels** that introduce computer animation topics
- **A visual programming interface** allowing the user to control gameobjects
- **Documentation** for every node and computer animation concept
- A global **FAQ page** answering common questions

## Step 1: Start the First Level

Click the big **Play** button on the homepage to jump into the first level. An interactive tutorial will walk you through:

- What each part of the interface does
- How to interact with the node editor

Alternatively, you can pick a level manually by selecting one of the **level cards** on the homepage.

## Step 2: Learn by Doing

Each level introduces a specific concept (e.g., time-transformations, for-loops, inverse kinematics). Levels are designed to be solved using the node-based system — experiment freely!

If you're ever stuck, click the **?** button to view hints or navigate to the level guide outlining detailed explanations and strategies.

## Step 3: Explore the Docs

The [Docs](/docs) page contains everything you need:

- Full documentation for every **node type**
- Reference guides for **animation concepts** like forward/inverse kinematics, hierarchies, and time-transformations

## Tips for Success

- Use the **Import** and **Export** nodes to read and write data from and to game objects
- Don't be afraid to experiment — levels are safe to reset at any time
- Revisit solved levels to reinforce your understanding

Ready to begin? Hit **Play** and start creating!
