# Level 9: Forward

## Objective

This level introduces the concept of **Forward Kinematics (FK)**, a fundamental method in character animation, robotics, and simulation. The player is tasked with adjusting joint angles of two robotic arms to position platform endpoints. These platforms act as bridges, allowing a raccoon character to escape from a rooftop.

## Scenario

The player encounters a canyon between rooftops. Two mechanical arms, each composed of two rotational joints, are attached to the ground. A raccoon is stranded and seeks assistance. The arms terminate in movable platforms which can be manipulated by changing **joint angles** via export nodes. The goal is to position these platforms to form a continuous path across the gap.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand the concept of **joint hierarchies** and how parent transformations affect child components.
- Gain intuition for **rotational motion propagation** along kinematic chains.
- Learn to use FK to compute end-effector positions in a multi-joint system.
- Understand how **angle-space control** translates to **cartesian-space movement** in linked rigid systems.

## Key Concepts

### Forward Kinematics (FK)

Forward Kinematics computes the position and orientation of an end-effector given the angles of all preceding joints in the kinematic chain. Mathematically, FK is a composition of transformation matrices, typically in 2D or 3D, applied in sequence:

$$
T_\text{total} = T_\text{root} \cdot R_1 \cdot T_1 \cdot R_2 \cdot T_2 \cdot ... \cdot T_\text{end}
$$

Where:

- `R_i` are rotation matrices defined by joint angles
- `T_i` are translations along segment lengths
- The final transformation `T_total` positions the platform in world space

- [Transformation Hierarchies](/docs/hierarchies/transformation-hierarchies)

### Scene Graphs and Transformation Hierarchies

The arms operate as hierarchical transformation chains: each joint's rotation is **local** to its parent, but **cumulatively affects** the final position of the platform. This concept is handled efficiently by a **scene graph**, where parent-child relationships determine transformation order.

See:

- [Scene Graphs](/docs/hierarchies/scene-graphs)
- [Coordinate Systems](/docs/hierarchies/coordinate-systems)

### Interaction and Node Control

In this level:

- Each joint is associated with an **export node**, where users can input angle values in **degrees**.
- The node interface reflects a **degree-of-freedom (DOF)** model for controlling articulated systems.
- Manipulating each angle causes real-time visual updates in the scene, reinforcing the **cause-effect relationship** of FK.

## Strategic Goals

- Move the first joint to orient the initial segment of the arm.
- Adjust the second joint to fine-tune the platform's vertical and horizontal position.
- Coordinate both arms so that the raccoon can traverse from one platform to the next.
