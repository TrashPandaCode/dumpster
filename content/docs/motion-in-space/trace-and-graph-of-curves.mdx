## Trace and Graph of Curves


* **Trace (Spur)**: The image set of the function

  $$
  \text{Trace}(f) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^d : \exists t \in I \text{ with } x = f(t)\}
  $$

  It represents where the curve passes in space but loses the time information.

* **Graph**: Combines trace *and* time:

  $$
  \text{Graph}(f) = \{(t, x) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^d : t \in I \text{ and } x = f(t)\}
  $$

We can derive the trace from the graph by omitting $t$, but not the other way around.
