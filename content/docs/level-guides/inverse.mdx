# Level 11: Inverse

## Objective

This level introduces the foundational concept of **inverse kinematics (IK)** by requiring the player to control a robotic arm to position a soap block directly above the raccoon. The raccoon moves side-to-side across the scene, and the soap must **stay in contact with the raccoon for at least 5 seconds**.

To solve this, the player must implement a **2D version of the Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD) algorithm** using a `for-loop`, manipulating the rotations of a kinematic chain consisting of three rotational joints.

## Scene Setup

- A **robotic arm** with **3 joints**, each capable of full $$360\degree$$ rotation
- The joints are **positionally parented**, but their rotations remain independent
- The **soap block** is considered the **end effector** of the arm
- The **raccoon** runs from left to right beneath the arm

The user's task is to adjust the joint angles such that the end effector (the soap) follows the raccoon's position.

## Key Concepts Introduced

- **Inverse Kinematics (IK)**
- **Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD)** in 2D
- **World-to-local coordinate transformations**
- **Iterative refinement using for-loops**

## CCD Algorithm in 2D

In CCD, each joint in the kinematic chain is adjusted iteratively to reduce the distance between the **end effector** and the **target**. In this 2D variant:

- No need to compute 3D rotation axes or quaternions
- The required joint rotation is computed using the [`atan2`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2) function

### Pseudo Code for CCD Iteration (per joint)

```plaintext
for each joint from last to first:
    endLocal = worldToLocal(joint, endEffector)
    targetLocal = worldToLocal(joint, target)

    angleEnd = atan2(endLocal.y, endLocal.x)
    angleTarget = atan2(targetLocal.y, targetLocal.x)

    deltaAngle = angleTarget - angleEnd

    joint.rotation += deltaAngle
```

This pseudocode can be implemented using basic [`Math`](/docs/nodes/math) nodes and the [`WorldToLocal`](/docs/nodes/worldtolocal) node.

### Using the `WorldToLocal` Helper Node

To simplify the coordinate conversion, use the [`WorldToLocal`](/docs/nodes/worldtolocal) utility node.

This utility node avoids manual matrix operations. For advanced users this can be implemented manually.

## Game Object Control

- Use nodes to obtain:

  - The **position of the raccoon** (via `Import` node) or
  - The **mouse position** (via `MousePos` node)

- Use the `Import` node to get all joint positions and rotations
- Use the `Export` node to apply **new rotation values** to each joint of the robotic arm

## Educational Notes

This level bridges **mathematical modeling** and **animation logic**, requiring learners to:

- Understand **kinematic chains** and their articulation
- Apply **rotational geometry** in local vs. world space
- Implement **iterative convergence algorithms** in a dataflow environment
