## Rotation Matrices

Rotation matrices are **orthogonal matrices** with determinant 1. The set of all rotation matrices is denoted as ("S O three"):

$$
\mathrm{SO}(3) := \{ A \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3} : A^T A = I \ \text{and} \ \det A = 1 \}
$$

So, $A$ is an **orthonormal matrix** (its column vectors are orthogonal to each other and have unit length).

Given two rotation matrices $A, B$, both $AB$ and $BA$ are also rotation matrices â€” but they are generally **not equal**. Rotations do **not** commute.

**Problems of rotation matrices:**

* Many/non-intuitive components (9 in total)
* Hard to interpret
* Interpolation often gives poor or incorrect results
