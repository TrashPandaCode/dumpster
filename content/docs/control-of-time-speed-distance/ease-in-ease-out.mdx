## Ease-In and Ease-Out

There are many ways to reparameterize a curve such that the speed starts slowly, increases to a maximum, and slows down to zero by the end of the domain.

We assume the curve is a $C^1$-curve parameterized by arc length. That is:

$$
\|f'(t)\| = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad l_f(t) = t
$$

To achieve an **ease-in and ease-out** effect, we can define a "trapezoid-shaped" function for the speed and integrate it.
