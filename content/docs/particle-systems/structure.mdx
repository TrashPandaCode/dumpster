## Structure of a Particle System

Particle systems consist of — particles... These have a position, velocity, etc.

They can "die" or be "born," and in the time between, they "live" — participating in the simulation. Each simulation frame involves the following steps:
+ Generate new particles
+ Assign initial state to new particles
+ Remove dying particles
+ Update the remaining particles
