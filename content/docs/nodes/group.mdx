# Group

The _Group_ node allows you to organize and encapsulate multiple nodes within a single container.

## Functionality

- Nodes dragged into the _Group_ node become its children and are positioned relative to the _Group_ node.
- Nodes dragged out of the _Group_ node are automatically ungrouped.
- Deleting a _Group_ node will not delete its children, the children will be placed back into the node canvas.
- Duplicating a _Group_ node will duplicate all of its child nodes as well.
