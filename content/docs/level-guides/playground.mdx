# Level 12: Playground

## Objective

This level is designed as an **open-ended playground** where users can freely experiment with all available nodes and concepts introduced in previous levels. There are no explicit puzzles to solve; instead, the focus is on **creative exploration**, hypothesis testing, and system mastery.

## Scenario

The player enters a quiet courtyard filled with a few interactive objects: a waving **flag**, a **trashcan (full and empty)**, and a curious **raccoon**. This space provides a rich canvas for practicing and combining animation techniques, experimenting with node behaviors, and observing system interactions.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gain fluency in connecting, configuring, and modifying various node types.
- Integrate and apply concepts from motion, time, hierarchy, kinematics, interpolation, and more.
- Develop a personal understanding of animation system behaviors by observing results of creative compositions.
- Learn through **trial and error** in a low-pressure environment.

## Available Game Objects

- **Flag**
- **Trashcan (Filled/Empty)**
- **Raccoon**

These objects are hookable to the scene graph and respond to exported values through the node system.

## Educational Purpose

By removing external constraints, this sandbox empowers users to:

- Build intuition about system behavior.
- Discover unexpected outcomes.
- Reinforce theoretical knowledge with practice.
- Begin designing custom control systems.
