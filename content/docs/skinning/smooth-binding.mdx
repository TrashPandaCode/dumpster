## Smooth Binding

In **smooth binding**, a vertex is influenced by the movement of multiple joints.

We now define a mapping that assigns each vertex to a *set* of joints:

$$
g: \mathcal{V} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{G})
$$

(where $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{G})$ is the power set of $\mathcal{G}$, i.e., all subsets)

As with rigid binding, we compute the vertex coordinates in joint-local coordinates. This set is collected as:

$$
\mathcal{B}_i = \{ b_i^{[k]} : k \in g(i) \}
$$

To determine the influence of the various joints on a vertex, we define a **weight function**:

$$
\omega : \mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{G} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

which assigns each vertex $i$ and joint $k$ a weight $\omega(i, k) \in \mathbb{R}$.
If $\omega(i, k) = 0$, then vertex $i$ is not influenced by joint $k$. The sum of all weights for a vertex should be 1.

Animation is now defined just like rigid binding, but with multiple joints per vertex. For each vertex $i$, and joint $k \in g(i)$, we define individual trajectories:

$$
v_{i,k}(t) = M^{[k]}(t) \cdot b_i^{[k]}
$$

The final position is a weighted sum:

$$
v_i(t) = \sum_{k \in g(i)} \omega(i, k) \cdot v_{i,k}(t)
$$


Due to linear interpolation of different vertex positions, the center vertex may collapse â€” this is referred to as the **candy wrapper effect** (see figure). This effect also appears in real human joints, like elbows. A potential solution is to use **blendshapes** (see [Blendshapes](/docs/blendshapes/definition)).
