## Delta Blendshapes

If we select one of the targets (typically the first, "neutral" one) as the **base**, we can compute **delta blendshape vectors** as the difference between each target and the base.

We then write the resulting shape as a weighted sum of these deltas, and add back the base vector:

$$
f = b_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{n} u_k \, \Delta b_k
$$

$$
f = b_0 + \Delta B u
$$

Where:

* $b_0$: base blendshape vector
* $\Delta b_k$: delta between target $k$ and base
* $u \in \mathbb{R}^n$: new weight vector
* $\Delta B$: matrix of delta blendshape vectors
